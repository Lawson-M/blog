Survive is a small survival game where you dodge incoming red cubes.

This was a very simple project and another one of the first I in web development. Although it was simple I believe that it helped me learn a lot of important elements of web development. Such as:

* Key handeling and user interaction with the webpage.
* Objects and how to make them move around the page
* Having objects affect other objects
* Using intervals, arrow functions, and user inputs and outputing resulting calculations graphically.
