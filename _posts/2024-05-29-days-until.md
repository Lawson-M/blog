Days until is a small project that shows you how far away we are from select dates. The web page also allows you to put in a custom date and will return how far away, or how far past that date we are.

This was one of the first web-projects I did, I wanted to become more comfortable with taking in user information to return calculations. I also wanted to become better with using intervals to keep the page updated with information.
