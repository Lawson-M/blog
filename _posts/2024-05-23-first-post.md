Hey! Thanks for checking out my development blog. I started making this site in my journey to explore different web technologies, this one's main concept and tool being Jekyll. I love the organization and the customization that jekyll provides while eleminating the need for a database with a lot of small functionalities (like page creation for a blog!).

I'll continue to post new projects that I finish here to make the blog feel more like home. Thanks again for visiting and feel free to check my thoughts and explanations on the blog, or some of my actual web projects on my main website "lawson-m.github.io".
